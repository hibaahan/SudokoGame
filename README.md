# SudokoGame
This console-based Sudoku game allows players to solve a pre-defined 9x9 grid by following the classic Sudoku rules. Players can start a new game, continue solving the current grid, or exit through a simple menu. The game validates each move to ensure the chosen number does not already exist in the selected row, column, or 3x3 sub-grid, adhering to Sudoku's rules. If the move is valid, the number is added to the grid; otherwise, an error message is displayed. The game provides feedback on progress and checks for a win condition, where the grid is fully and correctly completed. With its user-friendly design and clear instructions, the game offers a fun and interactive way to practice Sudoku logic.
